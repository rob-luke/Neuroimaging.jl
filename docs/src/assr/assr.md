Auditory steady state-responses (ASSRs) are neural responses to periodic auditory stimuli (Picton, 2010). When a repetitive stimulus is perceived by the listener, EEG measurements contain increased activity at the repetition or modulation frequency (fm). The frequency specific nature of the response allows for truly objective response detection. The most common use of ASSRs is to obtain frequency specific hearing thresholds, this is achieved by reducing the stimulus intensity until no response is detected (Rance et al., 1995).
