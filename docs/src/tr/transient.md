# Transient Responses

"In general, transient responses are evoked by stimuli
that occur infrequently (in theory, only once), and steady-state
responses are evoked by stimuli that occur more rapidly."
Picton (2002)

There is a wide variety of transient neurophysiological measures.
Within the auditory field these are commonly delineated by their
latency and anatomical source location. Fast (2-20 ms) responses are
often described as auditory brainstem response. Middle (10-100 ms) are
commonly termed middle latency responses or midbrain evoked potentials.
And slow cortical responses (50-300 ms) are commonly called P1-N1-P2 complexes.
There is also late responses (150-1000 ms) which are also cortical in
nature and include mismatched negativity responses, P300, N400, P600 responses.

I assume things are similar for other cognitive fields, but given how
us researchers don't talk outside our circles, they probably have different naming.
