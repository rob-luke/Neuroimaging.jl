# Low-Level Function API

As well as providing convenient types for analysis.
This package also provides low-level functions for dealing with
data in its raw form.
These low-level functions are described below.

Note: Currently sorting out the docs, so its a bit of a mess.
Is there an automated way to list all functions using documenter?
